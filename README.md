Website template was based on template based using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [FontAwesome](https://origin.fontawesome.com/) for icons, and [Github Pages]().

This homework was where I created a parallel coordinate graph in D3 and do data analysis of Baseline Cross-Sectional Estimates of Child and Parent Income Distributions by College. I ended up prototyping in RawGraphics and implementing in D3 V5.
