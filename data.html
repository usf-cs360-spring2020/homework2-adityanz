            <p> For these specific visualizations, I ended up using</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Passenger Count </li>
            <li>Activity Period (Converted to Year)</li>
            <li>GEO Country (Registered Country) </li>
            <li>Boarding Area</li>

        <h3 id="wrangling">Wrangling</h3>
        <p> I originally downloaded the whole dataset since I wanted to work with more categories. </p>
        <p> The data had to be sorted and fitlered out and I ended up doing it based on the time periods, I filtereted out uncommon and unecessary data manually through tableu functions prior to importing into javscript. </p>
        <p> However, I did use the javascript sort function in order to reorder the data based on ascending and/or alphabetical order </p>
        <p> It was important to see the relevance and the importance of the data. </p>
