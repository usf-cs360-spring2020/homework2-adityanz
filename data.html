            <cite>As part of our research studies, we put out publicly available datasets that can be used by other researchers and practitioners to support their own work. These datasets allow you to analyze social mobility and a variety of other
              outcomes from life expectancy to patent rates by neighborhood, college, parental income level, and racial background. You can search for datasets by geographic level (e.g., Census tracts), by topic (e.g., education), or by the title of
